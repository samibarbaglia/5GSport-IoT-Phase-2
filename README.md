# 🌐 Innovation IoT Project

This project integrates a **Movesense device** and a **Bynav M10 module** with a **Raspberry Pi Pico WH**, forming an IoT system that collects movement and GNSS data and forwards it to an MQTT broker over Wi-Fi.

## 📱 movesense-device-app

Firmware application for the Movesense device.

### 🔧 Description

The application utilizes the GATT SensorData protocol to communicate with a client device (Raspberry Pi Pico WH). It includes a movement detection feature and implements power-saving behavior:

- If no movement is detected and BLE connection is lost for 60 seconds, the Movesense device enters PowerOff mode to conserve battery.
- The device automatically wakes from PowerOff when:
  - Movement is detected, or
  - A BLE connection is re-established.

## 🧠 picoW-app

Firmware application for the Raspberry Pi Pico WH.

### 🔧 Description

The Pico WH functions as both a microcontroller and an IoT gateway, performing the following tasks:

- Connects to the Movesense device using the GATT SensorData service to retrieve sensor data.
- Reads location data from a GNSS module (Bynav M10).
- Forwards combined data to a pre-configured MQTT broker over Wi-Fi.

Tested on MicroPython firmware v1.22.

### 🧠 MicroPython firmware v1.22

🔗 The BLE stack is re-configured with built firmware `micropython-v1.22-blestack.uf2`, allow the Pico WH to connect to up to 3 peripherals simultaneously with GATT protocol.

### 📦 Required MicroPython Packages

- `micropython-umqtt.simple`
- `micropython-umqtt.robust`
